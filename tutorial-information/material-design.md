Material Design Tutorial
------------------------

I plan on using the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) library for my project. I really like the style of Material Design over a library like Bootstrap.

This past semester, I spent some time familiarizing myself with what this library ahs to offer. I did some of the labs that they offer [here](https://material.io/collections/developer-tutorials/#web), particularly the Material Basics (Web 101) and the Structure and Layout (Web 102) just to get an idea of how to use some of the features. You can find the github repo to start these labs [here](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-codelabs) For Web 101, I created a login page that had dynamic frontend features, like textfields that changed layout and color when they are clicked on. It also implemented the MDC button and ripple effect for when buttons are clicked. For Web 102, I worked on a home page that built off of the previous lab. It implemented a menu bar with MDC List and MDC Drawer. The components of the menu are listed with MDC List within the MDC Drawer (navigation drawer) container. I also learned how to include pictures using MDC image list. You can use the component to display repeating images in "lists". While I don't think that I will use this in particular, I thought it was a pretty cool feature of Material Design.
