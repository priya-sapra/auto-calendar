# auto-calendar

## Project Description
> Users can enter basic weekly schedules with classes and clubs with information about the events, such as days, times, locations, etc., and the application will generate a semester long calendar that has this weekly schedule for the entire semester. Then, the user will be able generate an ICS file with all the details of the weekly schedule. The goal is to make it easier to put course and club schedules in calendars without having to edit each individual event block for the week to set the repetition cycles for the semester and making different events simply because a class has a different time block on different days. Users will be able to enter all the times, days of the week, and locations for the class or course in one entry
